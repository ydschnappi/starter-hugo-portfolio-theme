title: Efficient Path Planning for Modular Robot.
summary: This thesis proposes two extensions to sampling-based path planning algorithms that leverage previous results. The first algorithm only tries to connect the previous path to the desired goal with the changed kinematics, while the second algorithm identifies candidates for the inverse kinematic solution of the new robot from the previously calculated solution path.
